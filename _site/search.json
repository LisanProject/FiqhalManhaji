Where beneficial, cross-references will be added from other relevant Shafi’i works, such as Taqrirat al-Sadidah, and the broader tradition of usul and fiqh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote\n\n\n\n\nكنت أصفح الورقة بين يدي مالك صفحا رفيقا هيبة له، لئلا يسمع وقعها\n“I used to turn the page gently in front of Malik out of reverence for him, lest he hear its sound.”\n— Imam al-Shafi’i"
