# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The long-term goal of this project is to provide an accessible, organized study companion for English-speaking students of sacred law, rooted in reliable Shafi'i methodology and sources (as taught by Shaykh Mahdi Lock)

---

## Organization

The content follows the topical arrangement of the original *Al-Fiqh al-Manhaji* volumes, beginning with purification and prayer, and progressing through the major sections of worship, transactions, personal law, and social obligations. Each section is broken into:

- Main rulings and definitions  
- Evidence when included  
- Summary tables where beneficial  
- Notes, commentary, or clarifications based on trusted works like *Taqrirat al-Sadidah*

---

### Chapters Currently in Progress

1. **Purification (al-Taharah)**  
2. **Prayer (al-Salah)**  
3. **Zakat**  
4. **Fasting (al-Siyam)**  
5. **Hajj and Umrah**

More will be added over time, and each chapter will eventually include details on the footnotes and commentaries by the authors. Before going into Fiqh al-Manhaji itself, an introduction to the foundation and origin of the Madhab through a translation of the beginning portion of Taqrirat al-Sadidah is provided.
