# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This document is a working companion to **_Al-Fiqh al-Manhaji: A Systematic Manual According to the Madhhab of Imam al-Shafi'i_**, authored by **Dr. Mustafa al-Khin**, **Dr. Mustafa Dib al-Bugha**, and **Dr. Ali al-Sharbaji**.

It is based on and inspired by ongoing **lectures by Shaykh Mahdi Lock**, and aims to support students of the Shafi'i madhhab through:

- **Structured and summarized fiqh notes**  
- **Clarifications of key legal rulings and definitions**  
- **Side references from classical commentaries**  
- **Thematic breakdowns by chapter and legal category**  
- **Occasional comparisons with other madhahib where relevant**  

The long-term goal is to provide an accessible, organized study companion for English-speaking students of sacred law, rooted in reliable Shafi'i methodology and sources.

## Organization

The content follows the topical arrangement of the original *Al-Fiqh al-Manhaji* volumes, beginning with purification and prayer, and progressing through the major sections of worship, transactions, personal law, and social obligations. Each section is broken into:

- Main rulings and definitions  
- Evidence when included  
- Summary tables where beneficial  
- Notes, commentary, or clarifications based on trusted teachers and works like *Taqrirat al-Sadidah*

---

### Chapters Currently in Progress

1. **Purification (al-Taharah)**  
2. **Prayer (al-Salah)**  
3. **Zakat**  
4. **Fasting (al-Siyam)**  
5. **Hajj and Umrah**

More will be added over time, and each chapter will eventually include details on the footnotes and commentaries by the authors.
