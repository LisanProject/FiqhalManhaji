# Introduction to the Shafi'i School

## The Founder of the School

Muhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi'i al-Muttalibi is the founder of the Shafi'i school. His lineage connects with that of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ at their common ancestor, Abd Manaf. He was born in Gaza in the year 150 AH and was brought to Mecca, where he began his pursuit of knowledge.

He studied under Imam Khalid ibn Muslim al-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca, as well as under al-Fudayl ibn Iyad, Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, and others.

Then he traveled to Madinah at the age of twelve, and memorized the entire *Muwattaʼ* in nine days, intending to stay with Imam Malik. He studied under Imam Malik until he became one of his top students. He also took knowledge from the scholars of Madinah and Mecca. He engaged deeply in Arabic linguistics and poetry and was praised for his mastery. Even al-Asma'i benefited from him, and he learned from the ancient poetry of the Banu Hudhayl tribe.

He traveled to Yemen and took knowledge from scholars such as Mutarrif ibn Mazin, Hisham ibn Yusuf the judge, Amr ibn Abi Salamah, and Yahya ibn Hasan. Then he traveled to Iraq and studied with Waki', Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, the jurist of Iraq, and others such as Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abu Thawr, and others.

He composed the book *Al-Hujjah* and established what became known as the old school of thought. Later, he took knowledge from the scholars of Egypt, such as Imam Ahmad ibn Abi Surayj and others, and turned toward Egypt, where his juristic reasoning matured through extensive debate. He revised some of his earlier opinions and established the new school of thought.

He is regarded as the renewer (mujaddid) of the second century, as he combined between the sciences of hadith and the intellectual reasoning of opinion-based jurisprudence. He laid down the foundations of usul al-fiqh, authoring *Al-Risalah*, the first book on legal theory. His knowledge extended across hadith, Qur'an, Arabic, grammar, history, poetry, and theology. He lived a life of asceticism and worship, turning away from the world and preferring the hereafter. He passed away in Egypt in the year 204 AH.

Imam Ahmad said: "Imam al-Shafi'i was like the sun for the world and like health for the body — can either of these be replaced or substituted?"

He also said: "Knowledge of jurisprudence was locked up with its people until God opened it through al-Shafi'i."

Imam Abu Zur'ah said about him: "I do not know of anyone who had a greater impact on the people of Islam than al-Shafi'i."

May God have mercy on them and be pleased with them all.
