## Distinct Merits of the Shafi'i Madhhab

The Shafi'i school is distinguished by many unique features, of which we mention:

### 1. Strong Foundation on Textual Proof  
Its founder, may Allah have mercy on him, based the school firmly on scriptural evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah. He was a student of Imam Malik and learned directly from the followers of the Prophet’s companions. Later scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal followed him, and the great hadith masters such as al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani served the madhhab by compiling evidences, demonstrating that many of the leading hadith scholars (*Huffadh, a memorizer of no less than 100,000 Ahadith with their respective chains of narraration!*) were from the Shafi'i school. 

### 2. Groundbreaking Work in Legal Theory  
Imam al-Shafi'i was the first to codify the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh) in a structured work. His students and their students developed major reference works, such as those by al-Juwayni and al-Ghazali, that became foundational texts across madhhab lines.

### 3. Balanced Methodology  
The madhhab strikes a balance between the rationalist approach (ahl al-ra'y) and the traditionalist approach (ahl al-hadith).

### 4. Widespread Ijtihad  
A large number of independent jurists (mujtahidun) emerged within the madhhab and made contributions in every era and region, such as al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salam, Ibn Daqiq al-'Id, al-Subki, al-Suyuti, and many others.

### 5. Rich Literature  
There is an abundance of books written by scholars verifying, refining, and supporting the madhhab throughout the centuries, making learning and research easier for students.

### 6. Global Reach  
Followers of the madhhab are found across the Muslim world — from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia to India, Persia, Iraq, the Levant, the Arabian Gulf, Hijaz, Hadramawt, Yemen, Egypt, and even parts of East Africa.

### 7. Successive Revivers  
At the start of nearly every century, a notable reviver (mujaddid) of the madhhab has emerged. Among them:

- Imam al-Shafi'i for the 2nd century  
- Abu al-Abbas ibn Surayj for the 3rd  
- Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari for the 4th  
- Abu Hamid al-Ghazali for the 5th  
- Fakhr al-Din al-Razi for the 6th  
- Imam al-Nawawi for the 7th  
- Al-Isnawi for the 8th  
- Ibn Hajar al-Haytami for the 9th  
- Al-Suyuti for the 10th
