## A Summary of the History of the Shafi'i Madhhab

The history of the madhhab can be summarized in five phases:

### 1. The Founding Phase  
This began with the establishment of the school and ended with the death of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him. During this phase, he authored foundational works such as *al-Umm*.

### 2. The Transmission Phase  
In this phase, his students and companions began spreading the madhhab. Among the most well-known of their writings is *Mukhtasar al-Muzani*.

### 3. The Expansion and Branching Phase  
This stage witnessed the documentation and expansion of legal issues within the madhhab. Two major methodological approaches emerged:

- **The Iraqi Approach**: Led by Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini, followed by al-Mawardi, Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari, al-Bandaniji, al-Mutamali, Salim al-Razi, and others.

- **The Khurasani (Persian) Approach**: Led by al-Qaffal al-Saghir Abu Bakr al-Marwazi, followed by Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni, al-Furani, al-Qadi Husayn, Abu Ali al-Sinji, al-Masudi, and others.

### 4. The Refinement Phase  
This was a period in which the leading scholars of the madhhab, such as al-Rafi'i and al-Nawawi, reviewed and analyzed the views of the madhhab, clarifying its issues and positions. Their most important works in this phase include:

- *al-Muharrar* and *al-Sharh al-Kabir* by al-Rafi'i  
- *al-Minhaj* and *al-Majmu'* (commentary on *al-Muhadhdhab*) by al-Nawawi  
- *Rawdat al-Talibin* by al-Nawawi  

In these works, they refined legal issues and weighed between competing reports and positions within the school.

### 5. The Consolidation Phase  
This phase is marked by the efforts of two great scholars:

- **Ibn Hajar al-Haytami**: Author of *Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj*  
- **al-Shams al-Ramli**: Author of *Nihayat al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj*  

These two expanded upon the works of al-Nawawi and al-Rafi'i, clarified unresolved matters, and addressed new branches and questions. Their contributions shaped the mature form of the madhhab.

If the madhhab has been authenticated with agreement between al-Nawawi and al-Rafi'i, then it is considered the relied-upon position (mu'tamad). If there is disagreement between the two, the matter is referred to Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli. If they agree, that becomes the relied-upon view. In cases of disagreement between them, scholars of different regions tend to follow one over the other:

- Scholars of the Hijaz, Hadramawt, and Egypt follow Ibn Hajar.  
- Scholars of al-Sham and Egypt tend to prefer al-Ramli.

## On Other Authors and Works

As for other authors whose writings are often transmitted, their opinions are accepted in legal practice and fatwa unless they are known to contain error, carelessness, or weakness â€” something only recognized by those well-trained in this field, i.e one who has taken from Shuyookh in this field.
