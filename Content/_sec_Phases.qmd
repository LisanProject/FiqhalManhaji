## A Summary of the History of the Shafi'i Madhhab

The history of the madhhab can be summarized in five phases:

### 1. The Founding Phase  
This began with the establishment of the school and ended with the death of Imam al-Shafi'i, may God be pleased with him. During this phase, he authored foundational works such as *al-Umm*.

### 2. The Transmission Phase  
In this phase, his students and companions began spreading the madhhab. Among the most well-known of their writings is *Mukhtasar al-Muzani*.

Al-Muzani, one of the closest students of Imam al-Shafi'i, played a pivotal role in transmitting the madhhab. His *Mukhtasar* became a foundational reference for later scholars.

His nephew, Abu Ja'far al-Tahawi, initially studied under him in the Shafi'i school. al-Muzani reportedly remarked:

> "You will never attain a high rank in knowledge."

Feeling dismissed and underestimated, al-Tahawi left the Shafi'i school and committed himself to the Hanafi tradition. In time, he rose to become one of its most authoritative jurists—authoring works like *Sharh Ma'ani al-Athar* and *Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah*, which continue to be studied across madhhabs to this day.

### 3. The Expansion and Branching Phase  
This stage witnessed the documentation and expansion of legal issues within the madhhab. Two major methodological approaches emerged:

- **The Iraqi Approach**: Led by Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini, followed by al-Mawardi, Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari, al-Bandaniji, al-Mahamili, Sulaym al-Razi, and others.

- **The Khurasani (Persian) Approach**: Led by al-Qaffal al-Saghir Abu Bakr al-Marwazi, followed by Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni, al-Furani, al-Qadi Husayn, Abu Ali al-Sinji, al-Masudi, and others.

### 4. The Codification Phase  
This stage was carried out at the hands of the two great scholars of the madhhab: al-Rafi'i and al-Nawawi. Among the most important works produced in this phase are:

- *al-Muharrar* *al-Sharh al-Saghir* and *al-Sharh al-Kabir*, all by al-Rafi'i, which are themselves based on al-Ghazali’s *al-Wajiz*.
- *al-Minhaj*, *al-Majmu' Sharh al-Muhadhdhab*, and *Rawdat al-Talibin*, all by al-Nawawi, which likewise draw upon *al-Wajiz*.

In these works, both scholars refined and systematically arranged the issues of the madhhab, clarified the evidences, and reconciled between the varying narrations and positions within the school.


### 5. The Consolidation Phase  
This phase is marked by the efforts of two great scholars:

- **Ibn Hajar al-Haytami**: Author of *Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj*  
- **al-Shams al-Ramli**: Author of *Nihayat al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj*  

In these works, both scholars compiled and analyzed rulings from across the school. They clarified points left unaddressed by earlier jurists (namely Nawawi and Rafi'i), referenced various transmitted positions, and organized them into a coherent legal system covering the entire breadth of jurisprudential topics.

Once the madhhab had been firmly established through the works of al-Nawawi and al-Rafi'i, it continued to flourish at the hands of Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli. Later scholars accepted their writings as authoritative in fatwa.

- When Nawawi and al-Rafi'i agree on a matter, their position is adopted as the **relied-upon** (mu'tamad).
- If they (Nawawi and Rafi'i) differ, the **opinion of al-Nawawi** is preferred.
- If both al-Nawawi and al-Rafi'i were silent on a matter, i.e neither spoke on a particular issue, one is free to choose either between the opinions Ibn Hajar al-Haytami or Shihab al-Ramli.
- When choosing between the opinions of Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli, **the people of the Hijaz and Hadramawt** prefer the *Tuhfah* of Ibn Hajar, whereas **Egyptians and Syrians** often favor the *Nihayah* of al-Ramli.

## On Other Authors and Works

As for other authors whose writings are often transmitted, their opinions are accepted in legal practice and fatwa unless they are known to contain error, carelessness, or weakness — something only recognized by those well-trained in this field, i.e one who has taken from Shuyookh in this field.
