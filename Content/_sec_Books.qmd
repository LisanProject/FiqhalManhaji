## The Most Important Books of the Shafi'i Madhhab

Books of fiqh in the madhhab are generally divided into the following categories: foundational texts (*mutun*), commentaries (*shuruh*), supercommentaries (*hawashi*), legal responses (*fatawa*), and others.

Among the most important books currently circulated in circles of learning are:

### Foundational Texts (*Mutun*)

- *Al-Risalah al-Jami'ah* by **Ahmad ibn Zayn al-Habashi**
- *Safinat al-Najah* by **Salim ibn Sumayr al-Hadrami**
- *Al-Muqaddimah al-Hadramiyyah* (both large and small versions) by **Abd al-Rahman Ba Fadl**
- *Al-Yaqut al-Nafis* by **Ibn Ahmad ibn Umar al-Shatiri**
- *Matn al-Ghayah wal-Taqrib* by **Abu Shuja' al-Asfahani**
- *Safwat al-Zubad* by **Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Raslan**
- *Umdat al-Salik* by **Ibn Naqib**

### Commentaries (*Shuruh*)

- *Nayl al-Raja* — on *Safinat al-Najah* by **Ahmad ibn Umar al-Shatiri**
- *Bushra al-Karim* — on *al-Muqaddimah al-Hadramiyyah* by **Sa'id ibn Muhammad Ba'ishin**
- Commentary on *Matn Abi Shuja'* by **Ibn Qasim al-Ghazzi**
- *Al-Iqna'* by **al-Khatib al-Shirbini**
- *Fath al-Allam* — on *Murshid al-Anam* by **al-Jurdani**
- *Fath al-Wahhab* — on *al-Minhaj* by **Zakariya al-Ansari**
- *Fath al-Muin* — on *Qurrat al-Ayn* by **Zayn al-Din ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Malibari**

#### Major Commentaries on Imam al-Nawawi’s *Minhaj*

- *Kanz al-Raghibin* by **al-Muhalli**
- *Mughni al-Muhtaj* by **al-Khatib al-Shirbini**
- *Nihayat al-Muhtaj* by **al-Ramli**
- *Tuhfat al-Muhtaj* by **Ibn Hajar al-Haytami**

::: {.callout-important title="Why These Commentaries Matter"}

These commentaries form the backbone of Shafi'i legal reasoning. They are not merely explanatory — they shape how the madhhab is transmitted, applied in fatwa, and taught around the world.

- They clarify ambiguous expressions in the core texts (*mutun*).
- They reconcile variant opinions and serve as the primary references for jurists and students alike.
- They preserve the reasoning of the madhhab's foremost authorities, including **Ibn Hajar**, **al-Ramli**, and **al-Nawawi**.

### Institutional Approaches

In institutions like **al-Azhar**, it is common for two or three major commentaries to be read alongside the *mutun* during lessons with the teacher. This approach emphasizes layered analysis, discussion, and legal evaluation in the classroom.

In contrast, in the **Hijaz**, particularly in **Yemen**, (think institutions like Dar al-Mustafa in Tarim) teachers focus primarily on the *mutun* in class. Students are expected to study the commentaries independently after mastering the texts. This fosters precision, retention, and discipline in the early stages of learning.
