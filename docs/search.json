    "section": "3.1 The Founder of the School",
    "text": "3.1 The Founder of the School\nMuhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi’i al-Muttalibi is the founder of the Shafi’i school. His lineage connects with that of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ at their common ancestor, Abd Manaf. He was born in Gaza in the year 150 AH and was brought to Mecca, where he began his pursuit of knowledge.\nHe studied under Imam Khalid ibn Muslim al-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca, as well as under al-Fudayl ibn Iyad, Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, and others.\nThen he traveled to Madinah at the age of twelve, and memorized the entire Muwattaʼ in nine days, to closely accompany Imam Malik. He studied under Imam Malik until he became one of his top students. He also took knowledge from the scholars of Madinah and Mecca and became qualified to give Fatawa at the age of 15. He engaged deeply in Arabic linguistics and poetry and was praised for his mastery. Even al-Asma’i (a transmitter of Arab poetry) benefited from him, and he learned from the ancient poetry of the Banu Hudhayl tribe.\nHe traveled to Yemen and took knowledge from scholars such as Mutarrif ibn Mazin, Hisham ibn Yusuf the judge, Amr ibn Abi Salamah, and Yahya ibn Hasan. Then he traveled to Iraq and studied with Waki’ ibn Jarrah, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, the jurist of Iraq.\nHe composed the book Al-Hujjah and established what became known as the old school of thought. Major scholars took knowledge from him, including Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abu Thawr, and others. He turned towards Egypt, revising many of his earlier legal opinions. There, he founded his new legal school.\nHe is regarded as the renewer (mujaddid) of the second century, as he combined between the sciences of hadith and the intellectual reasoning of opinion-based jurisprudence. He laid down the foundations of usul al-fiqh, authoring Al-Risalah, the first book on legal theory. His knowledge extended across hadith, Qur’an, Arabic, grammar, history, poetry, and theology. He lived a life of asceticism and worship, turning away from the world and preferring the hereafter. He passed away in Egypt in the year 204 AH.\nImam Ahmad said: “Imam al-Shafi’i was like the sun for the world and like health for the body — can either of these be replaced or substituted?”\nHe also said: “Knowledge of jurisprudence was locked up with its people until Allah opened it through al-Shafi’i.”\nImam Abu Zur’ah said about him: “I do not know of anyone who had a greater impact on the people of Islam than al-Shafi’i.”\nMay God have mercy on them and be pleased with them all.",

    "text": "3.3 A Summary of the History of the Shafi’i Madhhab\nThe history of the madhhab can be summarized in five phases:\n\n3.3.1 1. The Founding Phase\nThis began with the establishment of the school and ended with the death of Imam al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him. During this phase, he authored foundational works such as al-Umm.\n\n\n3.3.2 2. The Transmission Phase\nIn this phase, his students and companions began spreading the madhhab. Among the most well-known of their writings is Mukhtasar al-Muzani.\n\n\n3.3.3 3. The Expansion and Branching Phase\nThis stage witnessed the documentation and expansion of legal issues within the madhhab. Two major methodological approaches emerged:\n\nThe Iraqi Approach: Led by Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini, followed by al-Mawardi, Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari, al-Bandaniji, al-Mutamali, Salim al-Razi, and others.\nThe Khurasani (Persian) Approach: Led by al-Qaffal al-Saghir Abu Bakr al-Marwazi, followed by Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni, al-Furani, al-Qadi Husayn, Abu Ali al-Sinji, al-Masudi, and others.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 4. The Refinement Phase\nThis was a period in which the leading scholars of the madhhab, such as al-Rafi’i and al-Nawawi, reviewed and analyzed the views of the madhhab, clarifying its issues and positions. Their most important works in this phase include:\n\nal-Muharrar and al-Sharh al-Kabir by al-Rafi’i\n\nal-Minhaj and al-Majmu’ (commentary on al-Muhadhdhab) by al-Nawawi\n\nRawdat al-Talibin by al-Nawawi\n\nIn these works, they refined legal issues and weighed between competing reports and positions within the school.\n\n\n3.3.5 5. The Consolidation Phase\nThis phase is marked by the efforts of two great scholars:\n\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami: Author of Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj\n\nal-Shams al-Ramli: Author of Nihayat al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj\n\nThese two expanded upon the works of al-Nawawi and al-Rafi’i, clarified unresolved matters, and addressed new branches and questions. Their contributions shaped the mature form of the madhhab.\n\nIf the madhhab has been authenticated with agreement between al-Nawawi and al-Rafi’i, then it is considered the relied-upon position (mu’tamad). If there is disagreement between the two, the matter is referred to Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli. If they agree, that becomes the relied-upon view. In cases of disagreement between them, scholars of different regions tend to follow one over the other:\n\nScholars of the Hijaz, Hadramawt, and Egypt follow Ibn Hajar.\n\nScholars of al-Sham and Egypt tend to prefer al-Ramli.",

    "text": "3.6 Distinct Merits of the Shafi’i Madhhab\nThe Shafi’i school is distinguished by many unique features, of which we mention:\n\n3.6.1 1. Strong Foundation on Textual Proof\nIts founder, may Allah have mercy on him, based the school firmly on scriptural evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah. He was a student of Imam Malik and learned directly from the followers of the Prophet’s companions. Later scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal followed him, and the great hadith masters such as al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani served the madhhab by compiling evidences, demonstrating that many of the leading hadith scholars (Huffadh, a memorizer of no less than 100,000 Ahadith with their respective chains of narraration!) were from the Shafi’i school.\n\n\n3.6.2 2. Groundbreaking Work in Legal Theory\nImam al-Shafi’i was the first to codify the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh) in a structured work. His students and their students developed major reference works, such as those by al-Juwayni and al-Ghazali, that became foundational texts across madhhab lines.\n\n\n3.6.3 3. Balanced Methodology\nThe madhhab strikes a balance between the rationalist approach (ahl al-ra’y) and the traditionalist approach (ahl al-hadith).\n\n\n3.6.4 4. Widespread Ijtihad\nA large number of independent jurists (mujtahidun) emerged within the madhhab and made contributions in every era and region, such as al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salam, Ibn Daqiq al-’Id, al-Subki, al-Suyuti, and many others.\n\n\n3.6.5 5. Rich Literature\nThere is an abundance of books written by scholars verifying, refining, and supporting the madhhab throughout the centuries, making learning and research easier for students.\n\n\n3.6.6 6. Global Reach\nFollowers of the madhhab are found across the Muslim world — from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Southeast Asia to India, Persia, Iraq, the Levant, the Arabian Gulf, Hijaz, Hadramawt, Yemen, Egypt, and even parts of East Africa.\n\n\n3.6.7 7. Successive Revivers\nAt the start of nearly every century, a notable reviver (mujaddid) of the madhhab has emerged. Among them:\n\nImam al-Shafi’i for the 2nd century\n\nAbu al-Abbas ibn Surayj for the 3rd\n\nAbu al-Tayyib al-Tabari for the 4th\n\nAbu Hamid al-Ghazali for the 5th\n\nFakhr al-Din al-Razi for the 6th\n\nImam al-Nawawi for the 7th\n\nAl-Isnawi for the 8th\n\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami for the 9th\n\nAl-Suyuti for the 10th",
