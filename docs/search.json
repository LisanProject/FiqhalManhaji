    "section": "2.1 The Founder of the School",
    "text": "2.1 The Founder of the School\nMuhammad ibn Idris al-Shafi’i al-Muttalibi is the founder of the Shafi’i school. His lineage connects with that of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ at their common ancestor, Abd Manaf. He was born in Gaza in the year 150 AH and was brought to Mecca, where he began his pursuit of knowledge.\nHe studied under Imam Khalid ibn Muslim al-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca, as well as under al-Fudayl ibn Iyad, Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, and others.\nThen he traveled to Madinah at the age of twelve, and memorized the entire Muwattaʼ in nine days, to closely accompany Imam Malik. He studied under Imam Malik until he became one of his top students. He also took knowledge from the scholars of Madinah and Mecca and became qualified to give Fatawa at the age of 15. He engaged deeply in Arabic linguistics and poetry and was praised for his mastery. Even al-Asma’i (a transmitter of Arab poetry) benefited from him, and he learned from the ancient poetry of the Banu Hudhayl tribe.\nHe traveled to Yemen and took knowledge from scholars such as Mutarrif ibn Mazin, Hisham ibn Yusuf the judge, Amr ibn Abi Salamah, and Yahya ibn Hasan. Then he traveled to Iraq and studied with Waki’ ibn Jarrah, Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani, the jurist of Iraq.\nHe composed the book Al-Hujjah and established what became known as the old school of thought. Major scholars took knowledge from him, including Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Abu Thawr, and others.\nHe turned towards Egypt, revising many of his earlier legal opinions. There, he founded his new legal school.\nHe is regarded as the renewer (mujaddid) of the second century, as he combined between the sciences of hadith and the intellectual reasoning of opinion-based jurisprudence. He laid down the foundations of usul al-fiqh, authoring Al-Risalah, the first book on legal theory. His knowledge extended across hadith, Qur’an, Arabic, grammar, history, poetry, and theology. He lived a life of asceticism and worship, turning away from the world and preferring the hereafter. He passed away in Egypt in the year 204 AH.\nImam Ahmad said: “Imam al-Shafi’i was like the sun for the world and like health for the body — can either of these be replaced or substituted?”\nHe also said: “Knowledge of jurisprudence was locked up with its people until Allah opened it through al-Shafi’i.”\nImam Abu Zur’ah said about him: “I do not know of anyone who had a greater impact on the people of Islam than al-Shafi’i.”\nMay God have mercy on them and be pleased with them all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Humility of the Imam and the Wisdom of His Legacy\n\n\n\nImam al-Shafi’i once said:\n\n“I wish that the people would learn this knowledge and none of it be attributed to me.”\n\nIronically, or perhaps providentially, his du’a was accepted. The enduring beauty of the Shafi’i school is that it was polished, codified, and brought to legal maturity by the hands of scholars after him — such as al-Ghazali, al-Rafi’i, and al-Nawawi — who preserved the madhab in the clearest possible form.",

    "section": "2.3 A Summary of the History of the Shafi’i Madhhab",
    "text": "2.3 A Summary of the History of the Shafi’i Madhhab\nThe history of the madhhab can be summarized in five phases:\n\n2.3.1 1. The Founding Phase\nThis began with the establishment of the school and ended with the death of Imam al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him. During this phase, he authored foundational works such as al-Umm.\n\n\n2.3.2 2. The Transmission Phase\nIn this phase, his students and companions began spreading the madhhab. Among the most well-known of their writings is Mukhtasar al-Muzani.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Legacy of al-Muzani and the Departure of al-Tahawi\n\n\n\nAl-Muzani, one of the closest students of Imam al-Shafi’i, played a pivotal role in transmitting the madhhab. His Mukhtasar became a foundational reference for later scholars.\nHis nephew, Abu Ja’far al-Tahawi, initially studied under him in the Shafi’i school. However, when al-Tahawi showed signs of leaning toward the Hanafi madhhab, al-Muzani reportedly remarked:\n\n“You will never attain a high rank in knowledge.”\n\nFeeling dismissed and underestimated, al-Tahawi left the Shafi’i school and committed himself to the Hanafi tradition. In time, he rose to become one of its most authoritative jurists—authoring works like Sharh Ma’ani al-Athar and Aqidah al-Tahawiyyah, which continue to be studied across madhhabs to this day.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 3. The Expansion and Branching Phase\nThis stage witnessed the documentation and expansion of legal issues within the madhhab. Two major methodological approaches emerged:\n\nThe Iraqi Approach: Led by Abu Hamid al-Isfarayini, followed by al-Mawardi, Abu al-Tayyib al-Tabari, al-Bandaniji, al-Mahamili, Sulaym al-Razi, and others.\nThe Khurasani (Persian) Approach: Led by al-Qaffal al-Saghir Abu Bakr al-Marwazi, followed by Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni, al-Furani, al-Qadi Husayn, Abu Ali al-Sinji, al-Masudi, and others.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 4. The Codification Phase\nThis stage was carried out at the hands of the two great scholars of the madhhab: al-Rafi’i and al-Nawawi. Among the most important works produced in this phase are:\n\nal-Muharrar al-Sharh al-Saghir and al-Sharh al-Kabir, all by al-Rafi’i, which are themselves based on al-Ghazali’s al-Wajiz.\nal-Minhaj, al-Majmu’ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, and Rawdat al-Talibin, all by al-Nawawi, which likewise draw upon al-Wajiz.\n\nIn these works, both scholars refined and systematically arranged the issues of the madhhab, clarified the evidences, and reconciled between the varying narrations and positions within the school.\n\n\n2.3.5 5. The Consolidation Phase\nThis phase is marked by the efforts of two great scholars:\n\nIbn Hajar al-Haytami: Author of Tuhfat al-Muhtaj bi Sharh al-Minhaj\n\nal-Shams al-Ramli: Author of Nihayat al-Muhtaj ila Sharh al-Minhaj\n\nIn these works, both scholars compiled and analyzed rulings from across the school. They clarified points left unaddressed by earlier jurists (namely Nawawi and Rafi’i), referenced various transmitted positions, and organized them into a coherent legal system covering the entire breadth of jurisprudential topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Authority of Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli\n\n\n\nOnce the madhhab had been firmly established through the works of al-Nawawi and al-Rafi’i, it continued to flourish at the hands of Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli. Later scholars accepted their writings as authoritative in fatwa.\n\nWhen Ibn Hajar and al-Ramli agree on a matter, their position is adopted as the relied-upon (mu’tamad).\nIf they differ, the opinion of al-Nawawi is preferred.\nIf al-Nawawi was silent on the matter, either of the two may be relied upon.\nIf they both disagreed on a matter not addressed by earlier scholars, the people of the Hijaz and Hadramawt prefer Ibn Hajar, whereas Egyptians and Syrians often favor al-Ramli.",

    "text": "2.5 The Most Important Books of the Shafi’i Madhhab\nBooks of fiqh in the madhhab are generally divided into the following categories: foundational texts (mutun), commentaries (shuruh), supercommentaries (hawashi), legal responses (fatawa), and others.\nAmong the most important books currently circulated in circles of learning are:\n\n2.5.1 Foundational Texts (Mutun)\n\nAl-Risalah al-Jami’ah by Ahmad ibn Zayn al-Habashi\nSafinat al-Najah by Salim ibn Sumayr al-Hadrami\nAl-Muqaddimah al-Hadramiyyah (both large and small versions) by Abd al-Rahman Ba Fadl\nAl-Yaqut al-Nafis by Ibn Ahmad ibn Umar al-Shatiri\nMatn al-Ghayah wal-Taqrib by Abu Shuja’ al-Asfahani\nSafwat al-Zubad by Shihab al-Din Ahmad ibn Raslan\nUmdat al-Salik by Ibn Naqib\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Commentaries (Shuruh)\n\nNayl al-Raja — on Safinat al-Najah by Ahmad ibn Umar al-Shatiri\nBushra al-Karim — on al-Muqaddimah al-Hadramiyyah by Sa’id ibn Muhammad Ba’ishin\nCommentary on Matn Abi Shuja’ by Ibn Qasim al-Ghazzi\nAl-Iqna’ by al-Khatib al-Shirbini\nFath al-Allam — on Murshid al-Anam by al-Jurdani\nFath al-Wahhab — on al-Minhaj by Zakariya al-Ansari\nFath al-Muin — on Qurrat al-Ayn by Zayn al-Din ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Malibari\n\n\n2.5.2.1 Major Commentaries on Imam al-Nawawi’s Minhaj\n\nKanz al-Raghibin by al-Muhalli\nMughni al-Muhtaj by al-Khatib al-Shirbini\nNihayat al-Muhtaj by al-Ramli\nTuhfat al-Muhtaj by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy These Commentaries Matter\n\n\n\nThese commentaries form the backbone of Shafi’i legal reasoning. They are not merely explanatory — they shape how the madhhab is transmitted, applied in fatwa, and taught around the world.\n\nThey clarify ambiguous expressions in the core texts (mutun).\nThey reconcile variant opinions and serve as the primary references for jurists and students alike.\nThey preserve the reasoning of the madhhab’s foremost authorities, including Ibn Hajar, al-Ramli, and al-Nawawi.\n\n\n2.5.3 Institutional Approaches\nIn institutions like al-Azhar, it is common for two or three major commentaries to be read alongside the mutun during lessons with the teacher. This approach emphasizes layered analysis, discussion, and legal evaluation in the classroom.\nIn contrast, in the Hijaz, particularly in Yemen, teachers focus primarily on the mutun in class. Students are expected to study the commentaries independently after mastering the texts. This fosters precision, retention, and discipline in the early stages of learning.\nEach tradition carries its strengths — al-Azhar cultivates comparative analysis, while the Hijazi model emphasizes firm mastery before engaging multiple views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Supercommentaries (Hawashi)\n\nSupercommentary by al-Bajuri on the commentary of Ibn Qasim on Matn Abi Shuja’\nSupercommentary by Bakri ibn Shatta al-Dimyati on Fath al-Muin\nSupercommentary by Abd Allah ibn Hajjazi al-Sharqawi on Sharh al-Tahrir\nMadinan tradition of supercommentaries on Ibn Hajar’s Muqaddimah, notably:\n\nMuhammad ibn Sulayman al-Kurdi\nal-Tarmisi\n\nal-Bujayrimi on al-Iqna’ of al-Khatib\nal-Jamal and al-Bujayrimi on Sharh al-Minhaj\nFurther supercommentaries on Minhaj al-Talibin exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnpublished Treasures\n\n\n\nSome supercommentaries remain in manuscript form and are in the process of being published.

    "section": "2.6 Distinct Merits of the Shafi’i Madhhab",
    "text": "2.6 Distinct Merits of the Shafi’i Madhhab\nThe Shafi’i school is distinguished by many unique features, of which we mention:\n\n2.6.1 1. Strong Foundation on Textual Proof\nIts founder, may Allah have mercy on him, based the school firmly on scriptural evidence from the Qur’an and Sunnah. He was a student of Imam Malik and learned directly from the followers of the Prophet’s companions. Later scholars like Ahmad ibn Hanbal followed him, and the great hadith masters such as al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani served the madhhab by compiling evidences, demonstrating that many of the leading hadith scholars (Huffadh, a memorizer of no less than 100,000 Ahadith with their respective chains of narraration!) were from the Shafi’i school.\n\n\n2.6.2 2. Groundbreaking Work in Legal Theory\nImam al-Shafi’i was the first to codify the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh) in a structured work. His students and their students developed major reference works, such as those by al-Juwayni and al-Ghazali, that became foundational texts across madhhab lines.\n\n\n2.6.3 3. Balanced Methodology\nThe madhhab strikes a balance between the rationalist approach (ahl al-ra’y) and the traditionalist approach (ahl al-hadith).\n\n\n2.6.4 4. Widespread Ijtihad\nA large number of independent jurists (mujtahidun) emerged within the madhhab and made contributions in every era and region, such as al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salam, Ibn Daqiq al-’Id, al-Subki, al-Suyuti, and many others.\n\n\n2.6.5 5.
